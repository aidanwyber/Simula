# ⚖️ p5Catalyst Community Code of Conduct

Welcome to the p5Catalyst project! This community includes people from around the world working on creative coding, design systems, motion graphics, and generative design. Whether you're contributing code, reporting bugs, designing interfaces, or doing visual experiments, we want to foster a space that's constructive and welcoming.

This Code of Conduct outlines basic expectations for community behaviour across GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, and any related communication platforms.

## Guidelines

* **Be welcoming and patient.** People of all experience levels are encouraged to contribute. Be open to helping newcomers and answering questions.

* **Be considerate.** Your decisions and contributions affect others. Respect the work of contributors and try to improve things for everyone.

* **Be respectful.** Disagreements are natural. Don't let frustration turn into personal attacks. Stay focused on solving problems, not assigning blame.

* **Use clear, professional language.** Avoid off-topic jokes or comments that could be misinterpreted. When giving feedback, be constructive and specific.

* **Collaborate in good faith.** We all have different skills, styles, and goals. Ask questions, offer support, and seek common ground when perspectives differ.

* **Avoid discrimination.** Treat all contributors with fairness and courtesy. Discriminatory behaviour based on personal characteristics or background is not acceptable.

## In Case of Issues

If you see behaviour that doesn't align with these principles—whether it's dismissive, hostile, or simply unhelpful—please raise it respectfully. Most misunderstandings can be cleared up with calm conversation. If that doesn't work, contact the maintainers privately to review the situation.

You can reach Aidan, the project maintainer, at [aidan.wyber@multitude.nl](mailto:aidan.wyber@multitude.nl). He's approachable and happy to help resolve concerns in a fair and constructive way.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behaviour

Instances of unacceptable behaviour may be addressed with warnings, temporary suspension, or permanent exclusion from the project. The maintainers reserve the right to take appropriate action based on the nature and severity of the incident.

## Maintainer Responsibility

Project maintainers are committed to enforcing this Code of Conduct consistently and fairly. They will evaluate reports thoroughly and protect the integrity of the project environment.

## Why This Matters

p5Catalyst is intended to be a platform where creative coding thrives through sharing, remixing, and iterating together. Keeping this a productive, creative space is everyone's responsibility.
