## 🔧 Code formatting

To keep the code clean and consistent, we use a **code formatter** (specifically, [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)). A formatter automatically adjusts your code layout—like indentation, spacing, and quotes—so everything follows the same style without needing to think about it.

#### 📁 How it’s configured

This project includes a Prettier setup under [`.vscode/settings.json`](./.vscode/settings.json). If you’re using [**VS Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/), it will automatically follow these settings when formatting your files. Just make sure you have the [Prettier plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) installed. Other IDEs like WebStorm or Sublime Text can also use Prettier, just match the config in [`.vscode/settings.json`](./.vscode/settings.json). I recommend enabling **Format on save**.

#### ✅ To format your code:

-   In **VS Code**: Press `Shift + Option + F` (Mac) or `Shift + Alt + F` (Windows)
-   Or: right-click a file and select **Format Document**
-   Or: run Prettier from the command line with `npx prettier --write .`

Formatting helps keep pull requests clean and focused on actual changes.
